<h2>Download</h2>
1. <b><a href="https://github.com/AKARI-B3/apb/archive/master.zip">Download</a></b> the APB Builder master and unzip! <a href="http://bitfund.cash/download_apb.png">http://bitfund.cash/download_apb.png</a> <a href="https://github.com/AKARI-B3/apb">https://github.com/AKARI-B3/apb</a><br>
2. Browse 'pagebuilder' folder <b>OR</b> visit <a href="http://bitfund.cash/pagebuilder">http://bitfund.cash/pagebuilder</a>
(If you're building offline, drag the index.html in pagebuilder directory to a new empty browser tab to run the .html)<br>
3. Build your page using the free <a href="http://bitfund.cash/pagebuilder">Builder</a> tool, follow instructions!

<h2>Modify then Upload</h2>
4. Create a free github or bitbucket.io account (or use a webhost you own or manage). Need email? Use <a href="http://Protonmail.com">Protonmail</a>! Your username and repository name will be used for your free fund page.<br>
5. Done building and replacing? Upload all the files to your webhost or github repository. Don't worry, you can also continue to build and modify once they're uploaded too.

<h2>Finishing Up</h2>
6. Doublecheck you've set your own receiving address correctly by renaming the payment file starting with "addr=" as per the instructions <A href="http://bitfund.cash/check_address.jpg">http://bitfund.cash/check_address.jpg</a><br>
7. <a href="http://bitfund.cash/github_settings.jpg">Enable GitHub Pages</a> Settings: On the settings tab, scroll down to where it says GitHub Pages, then choose your repository as master branch and save the new setting. This tells github your page must be at yourusername.github.io/yourfundname <br>
8. Wait 10 minutes for the new files to propagate. Now visit your page at yourusername.github.io/fundpage <br>
9. Tell us about the fundpage on reddit.com/u/akari_bit or https://memo.cash/profile/1D9QccNGQY9xspZ8J44CHuo5vThGZrqtzr or email akari.global@protonmail.com so we can put it on http://bitfund.cash<br>

<h2>Launching</h2>

<h2>What is AKARI-PAGES?</h2>
AKARI-PAGES is a free self-hosted Bitcoin Cash fundraiser page that <b>also</b> functions on free github.io pages or bitbucket.io pages that is easy to setup and customize using simple text files. Now it is even easier to begin thanks to the AKARI-PAGES Builder, a tool that makes editing the configuration files a snap!<br><br>

<a href="http://akari-b3.github.io/fundraiser">OUR DEMO PAGE</a> (hosted free on <a href="https://github.com/AKARI-B3/fundraiser">Github</a>)<br>

Uses "AKARI-PAY Advanced" Bitcoin Cash donate/pay tool, customizable through simple text file editing.    
<a href="https://github.com/AKARI-B3/akaripages"><img src="http://agf.earth/akari_pages_example.jpg"></a>    
Start your very own open-ended Bitcoin Cash Peer-2-Peer (P2P) Micro-fundraiser today, for free, with zero fees.
Includes goal progress, donation totals, goal levels, details about your fundraiser, and much more customization options.

Keep your page self-hosted or hosted on github.io pages. Do not post it on a website or service that you don't own or maintain access rights to. When you browse to your page, it will use the filename to prepare the payment page with included QR, copy-paste address, or mobile payment options. Having multiple ways to pay increases donations/payments significantly because it is much more convenient for the payee. Since it is self-hosted on your own servers or on github.io which includes version-control, that gives users more trust who are looking to pay or donate, increasing donations as well. 
If you're worried about it being modified via the FTP, setup an ftp monitor to alert you if files are changed.  You can easily keep track of your github.io/bitbucket.io files. If you are very worried, simply set up your own username account.

Enjoy your new payment / donate page and fundraising page!

Raise funds for anything using Bitcoin Cash AKARI-PAY Advanced + AKARI-PAGES, and now easily create a fund page using APB.
